title: Configuring Dalliance
---

There are many options you can configure when creating a Browser object.

<h5>chr/viewStart/viewEnd</h5>

These options configure the default view when the browser starts for the first time.

{%highlight javascript %}
    chr:          '22',
    viewStart:    30000000,
    viewEnd:      30030000
{%endhighlight%}

<h5>sources</h5>

An array of source or track configurations (see <a href="config-source.html">the source configuration guide</a>).

<h5>maxViewWidth</h5>

The maximum width of the visible region, configured in bases.  Default is 500000.

<h5>pageName</h5>

The id of an element on the page whose contents will be replaced with the Dalliance instance
when it starts up.

<h5>cookieKey</h5>

String used as a key for session persistance.  It should be unique amongst all Dalliance
instances served from a given domain.  Not relevant if <code>noPersist</code> is true.

<h5>coordSystem</h5>

This defines the reference genome coordinate system for the browser.  It's principally used when
querying the DAS registry to find relevant datasources.  It is also needed to correctly re-map data
between coordinate systems.  A typical configuration looks like:

{%highlight javascript %}
coordSystem: {
    speciesName: 'Danio rerio',
    taxon: 7955,
    auth: 'Zv',
    version: 9,
    ucscName: 'danRer7'
}
{%endhighlight%}

The <code>speciesName</code> field can be a human-readable label, and isn't used when querying the
registry.  <code>taxon</code> should be an integer identified from the <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy'>NCBI Taxonomy</a>
<code>auth</code> and <code>version</code> should, as far as possible, match authority and version strings used
in the <a href='http://dasregistry.org/'>DAS Registry</a>.

The <code>ucscName</code> field is optional, but should be filled in with the UCSC genome browser name of the assembly
if it is defined.  This enables <a href='#hub'>track-hub support</a> to work properly.

<h5>setDocumentTitle</h5>

If true, attempt to change the title of the web browser window to reflect the species name being displayed.  Generally not
wanted for embedded browsers.

<h5>uiPrefix</h5>

URL from which static browser UI resources should be downloaded (CSS, images, and help
pages).  By default, this
is <code>http://www.biodalliance.org/release-X.Y</code> code where X.Y represents the
current major and minor release numbers.

<h5>noPersist</h5>

Fully disables Dalliance's built-in session management.  When the page is reloaded, everything will be
reset to the configuration passed to the Browser constructor.

<h5>noPersistView</h5>

Disable storing the current location in the session-management system.  All other options (notably,
current track configurations are preserved).  This is useful if you are embedding little feature-centric
browser instances into a larger application (e.g. a database with one page per gene).

<h5>noDefaultLabels</h5>

Do not add the standard "tier tab" labels.  Intended for very lightweight embedded browser instances/

<h5>tierBackgroundColors</h5>

Array of CSS color strings used as background colors.  Dalliance cycles through the available
colours in order.  In the special case of this property being set to <code>null</code>, tiers
will have transparent backgrounds.  This is only recommended if there's a specific reason
for letting the background show through.

<h5>maxHeight</h5>

Maximum height, in CSS pixels, that the Dalliance component can grow to (default 500).

<h5>fullScreen</h5>

Attempt to fit the Dalliance component to the containing window, making allowances for other content on the page.


<h3><a id='hub'>Configuring a track-hub</a></h3>

As of Dalliance 0.9, there is rudimentary support for <a href='http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html'>UCSC-style
track hubs</a>, so long as they're server over HTTP and support CORS.  These can be configured with:

{%highlight javascript%}
hubs: ['http://www.biodalliance.org/datasets/testhub/hub.txt', 
       'http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/hub.txt']
{%endhighlight%}

...and will appear as extra tabs in the track-addition user interface.

<h3><a id='liftOver'>Configuring coordinate-system mappings</a></h3>

Dalliance can do on-the-fly coordinate system mapping.  The set of available mappings is configured by the <code>chains</code> property, which takes a map of mapping names to mapping definitions, e.g.:

{%highlight javascript %}
    chains: {
      hg18ToHg19: {uri: 'http://www.biodalliance.org/datasets/GRCh37/hg18ToHg19.bb',
                   type: 'bigbed',
                   coords: {
                        speciesName: 'Human',
                        taxon: 9606,
                        auth: 'NCBI',
                        version: 36
                   }
                  }
    }
{%endhighlight%}

You can use arbitrary strings as names for mappings.  When configuring a track in the <code>sources</code> array, you can specify which mapping to use, e.g.:

{%highlight javascript %}
sources: [
  {name: "My track",
   bwgURI: "http://some/old.data.bb",
   mapping: 'hg18ToHg19'}
]
{%endhighlight%}

Each mapping definition has the following properties:

<h5>uri</h5>

URI to access alignment data.

<h5>type (optional)</h5>

Currently supported values are "bigbed", which specifies a bigBed-encoded version of the chain file
format, produced by the <a href="https://github.com/dasmoth/hubbub">chain2bed</a> utility.  If <code>type</code> is not specified, alignment-DAS is assumed.  Alignment DAS support is deprecated as of
Dalliance 0.12.  Please contact Thomas Down for more details if you really need it.

<h5>credentials (optional)</h5>

Support credentials when accessing the alignment data.

<h5>coords (required)</h5>

The coordinate system that this mapping is <em>from</em> (it is assumed to be) <em>to</em> the default coordinate system of the browser.  This is important, because it controls what gets presented if the user is prompted to choose a coordinate system when the user manually adds data.  If possible, the <code>ucscName</code> of the coordinate system should also be specified -- if so, coordinate system mapping will be automatically supported when interacting with track-hubs which provide data for more than one genome assembly.

<h3><a id='uielements'>Fine-grained control over the default UI</a></h3>

<p>
Most of the UI can be diabled (it's also possible to run the Dalliance track component without <em>any</em> UI,
but that should probably be documented elsewhere).
