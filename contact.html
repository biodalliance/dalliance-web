Development happens in our <a href='http://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance'>GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please use the <a href="https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open">GitHub issue tracker</a>
to report bugs or request features.

<p>
For general discussion, we have a <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodalliance-dev'>Google Group</a>.  Sending messages
to the group is preferable to e-mailing the developers directly, because it leaves a public record of the discussion that might be
useful to other users or contributers in the future.  It should also get a quicker response!
