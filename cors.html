title: Making data available for Biodalliance
---
<p>
Biodalliance is a normal web application and must abide by all the restrictions
and security policies imposed on web applications.  The most significant of these
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin policy</a>.
Briefly, this means that a web page loaded from a given server can generally only
load additional resources from the same server.  There are some historical exceptions
to this (for instance, images can be loaded from anywhere), but these aren't relevant
to tools viewing custom data types.  Instead, a framework called 
<a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> has been developed to flag specific
resources as valid targets for cross-origin requests.  All major web browsers
have supported this for some years now, and Biodalliance relies on CORS for all
access to third party data.  CORS is straightforward to implement on most web
servers.
</p>

<p>
The same-origin policy and the CORS frameworks are based on the concept of
Origins.  The origin is the protocol, hostname, and (where specific) port
components of a URL.  The following are all different origins:

<ul>
<li>http://www.biodalliance.org/</li>
<li>http://www.biodalliance.org:8080/</li>
<li>https://www.biodalliance.org</li>
</ul>

even though they all actually point to the same server.
</p>

<p>
If you've installed your own instance of Biodalliance, and have some datasets
hosted on the same origin as the main page of your Biodalliance installation,
you'll be able to access that data from Biodalliance regardless of the CORS
status of those resources.  However, unless this is unreleased data that you're
displaying for your own use, please consider using CORS headers anyway, to make
your data easily accessible to other users of Biodalliance and other web-based
visualization tools.
</p>

<h2>CORS for data files</h2>

<p>
If you're serving static data files, you need to configure your web server to add
a few headers when serving up these files.  There's a helpful introduction on how
to do this in a wide variety of servers <a href="http://enable-cors.org/server.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
However, most file types accessed by Biodalliance are <em>indexed</em>, e.g.
bigWig, bigBed, Tabix, etc, and Biodalliance only fetches the required parts
of the file.  This is acheived by setting the <code>Range</code> header on
all requests.  Sending custom headers to cross-origin resources is a feature
which must be explicitly enabled with another CORS header.

{% highlight html %}
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Range
Access-Control-Max-Age: 36000
{% endhighlight %}

the <code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code> header is optional but allows caching of
CORS information, reducing the number of "pre-flight" HTTP requests that are required
and thus improving performance, especially over slower connections.
</p>

<p>
In the Apache server, a suitable configuration might look like:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Range"
Header set Access-Control-Max-Age "36000"
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>CORS for secure resources</h2>

Biodalliance is able to access resources with access controlled by HTTP authentication.
It can also potentially access resources with other access control systems (e.g. OAuth)
so long as suitable cookies have been set.  However, the combination of restricted access
resources and cross-origin access poses some additional complications.

<ul>
<li>An additional <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code> flag is required.</li>
<li>It is no longer permissable to use a wildcard in the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
header -- you must either hardcode a specific origin (e.g. http://www.biodalliance.org), or echo
back the value in the <code>Origin</code> request header.</li>
<li>If you're using HTTP authentication, you need to be aware that the browser will make an OPTIONS
request <em>before</em> prompting the user for authentication, and steps need to be taken to ensure
that this succeeds.</li>
</ul>

The following Apache configuration sample may be a helpful starting point:

{% highlight text %}
<Directory /var/www/secure/>
    Options  FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride FileInfo
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
    <LimitExcept OPTIONS>
        Require user dalliance
    </LimitExcept>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Dalliance security test"
    AuthUserFile /var/data/dalliance-passwd


    SetEnvIf Origin "http(s)?://.*$" AccessControlAllowOrigin=$0
    Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin %{AccessControlAllowOrigin}e env=AccessControlAllowOrigin
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Range"
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"       
</Directory>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>CORS for custom web services</h2>

If you are setting up custom web services to provide data to Biodalliance, you'll also
want to include an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in your responses.  DAS middleware
including Proserver and MyDAS implements CORS by default.
