<h2>I've seen an "HTTP Warning" message in Biodalliance</h2>

<p>
Brief version: your web browser doesn't allow web applications loaded over HTTPS
to access resources over HTTP.
</p>

<p>
Longer version: a number of major browser vendors have decided to impose strong
restrictions on "mixed content": situations where a web page or application loads
some resources over HTTPS and some over HTTP.  There are some good reasons for
this, for instance simplifying the semantics of the HTTPS "lock" icons which browser
display.  The long term intention is clearly to encourage wider (and eventually universal)
adoption of HTTPS.  However, there are some troublesome edge cases, in particular
for web-based data integration tools like Biodalliance.  Since Biodalliance 0.13.4,
we make a best-effort attempt to detect problems caused by mixed-content restrictions
and show the "HTTP Warning" error.
</p>

<p>
If you've seen the "HTTP Warning" error, you have three options:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to access the same data over HTTPS instead of HTTP.  Some web servers
support both protocols, so it's worth trying just changing "http:" to "https:" in
a URL.  If not, you could ask the data provider whether they would consider 
supporting HTTPS.</li>
<li>Tell your browser to allow mixed content.  There is probably a button in the
URL bar to enable this, although it may be quite subtle (e.g. the "shield" icon
in recent versions of Chrome, shown below):</li>
<img src="ss/chrome-mixed.png">
<li>Access Biodalliance itself over <a href="http://www.biodalliance.org/">HTTP</a>
rather than HTTPS.  We'd prefer that you didn't do this, but recognize that right
this option might be the least hassle...</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>HTTPS support status</h2>

<p>
Biodalliance supports HTTPS, both for fetching data and for hosting
the Biodalliance application itself.  All public data and code served
from www.biodalliance.org is available over both HTTP and HTTPS.  We
would encourage you to use HTTPS wherever possible.
</p>

<p>
That said, there can be some some issues when HTTP and HTTPS meet.
Some major browsers now default to preventing pages loaded over HTTPS
from accessing <strong>any</strong> HTTP resources, and this will lead
to errors if an HTTPS-based Biodalliance instance tries to fetch some
data over plain HTTP.
</p>

<h2>Protocol-relative URLs</h2>

<p>Biodalliance has full support for protocol-relative URLs, <i>i.e.</i> URLs
like:

<pre>
     //www.biodalliance.org/datasets/ensgene.bb
</pre>

these have a "hostname" part but no protocol part.  They imply that the
server is offering the same resources via both HTTP and HTTPS, and HTTPS
will be used when accessing the resource from an HTTPS page.
</p>

<h2>For data providers</h2>

<p>
Please, please, offer your data over HTTPS if at all possible.  Browser developers
and others are increasingly pushing HTTPS and it seems likely that unencrypted
HTTP <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/xaGffxAM-hs%5B1-25%5D">may
eventually be deprecated</a>.  Setting up HTTPS in web servers is now relatively
easy, and there are some options for obtaining SSL certificates for free.
