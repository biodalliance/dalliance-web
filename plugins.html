title: Adding plugins to Dalliance
---
Dalliance has a number of extension points aimed at making it easier
to customize the browser and better integrate it with your application.
If you can't find what you need, please ask!

<h3><a id='feature-info'>Feature info plugins</a></h3>

Feature Info plugins are run whenever the default feature-info box gets displayed (usually when the user clicks on a feature,
unless this behaviour has been over-ridden).  They are able to add extra rows to the feature-info box.  A minimal example is:

{% highlight javascript %}
browser.addFeatureInfoPlugin(function(f, info) {
    info.add('Testing', 'This is a test!');
});
{% endhighlight %}

You can add either strings (as above) or DOM elements.  If you want to add information which isn't yet available (e.g.
because you need to perform an AJAX request or other asynchronous operation to get hold of it), the simplest thing to
do is to add an empty <code>div</code> element then populate it once the data arrives
